@book{Spivak2014,
abstract = {Category theory was invented in the 1940s to unify and synthesize different areas in mathematics, and it has proven remarkably successful in enabling powerful communication between disparate fields and subfields within mathematics. This book shows that category theory can be useful outside of mathematics as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language throughout the sciences. Information is inherently dynamic; the same ideas can be organized and reorganized in countless ways, and the ability to translate between such organizational structures is becoming increasingly important in the sciences. Category theory offers a unifying framework for information modeling that can facilitate the translation of knowledge between disciplines. Written in an engaging and straightforward style, and assuming little background in mathematics, the book is rigorous but accessible to non-mathematicians. Using databases as an entry to category theory, it begins with sets and functions, then introduces the reader to notions that are fundamental in mathematics: monoids, groups, orders, and graphs—categories in disguise. After explaining the “big three” concepts of category theory—categories, functors, and natural transformations—the book covers other topics, including limits, colimits, functor categories, sheaves, monads, and operads. The book explains category theory by examples and exercises rather than focusing on theorems and proofs. It includes more than 300 exercises, with solutions. Category Theory for the Sciences is intended to create a bridge between the vast array of mathematical concepts used by mathematicians and the models and frameworks of such scientific disciplines as computation, neuroscience, and physics.},

abstract = {The paper presents a minimalistic and elegant approach to working with graphs in Haskell. It is built on a rigorous mathematical foun-dation — an algebra of graphs — that allows us to apply equational reasoning for proving the correctness of graph transformation al-gorithms. Algebraic graphs let us avoid partial functions typically caused by 'malformed graphs' that contain an edge referring to a non-existent vertex. This helps to liberate APIs of existing graph libraries from partial functions. The algebra of graphs can represent directed, undirected, reflex-ive and transitive graphs, as well as hypergraphs, by appropriately choosing the set of underlying axioms. The flexibility of the ap-proach is demonstrated by developing a library for constructing and transforming polymorphic graphs.},

abstract = {A new method for obtaining the recombinant DNA based on heteroduplex-initiated site-directed insertion of alien nucleotide sequences is proposed. To generate a single-stranded region, plasmid DNA was nicked with restriction endonuclease in the presence of ethidium bromide with subsequent exonuclease III controlled digestion. The inserted DNA sequences flanked by nucleotide sequences complementary to single-stranded region were annealed with plasmid DNA and E. coli cells were transformed by the resulting heteroduplex molecules. The presented data show the possibility to insert as many as 200 nucleotides. The yield of recombinant DNA varied from 16 to 0.7{\%} as the number of nucleotides inserted correspondingly varied from 15 to 200. The site of insertion does not depend crucially on the localization of the restriction site used.},

Over the following 40 odd years, the motivation for creating visual representations of graphs has changed from mathematical curiosity to Visual Analytics. Current demand for Graph Drawing methods is now high, because of the potential for more human-comprehensible visual forms in industries as diverse as Biotechnology, Homeland Security, and Sensor Networks. Many new methods have been proposed, tested, implemented, and found their way into commercial tools. This paper describes two strands of this history: the force directed approach, and the planarity approach. Both approaches originate in Tutte's paper.},

@book{Raynal2013,
abstract = {The advent of new architectures and computing platforms means that synchronization and concurrent computing are among the most important topics in computing science. Concurrent programs are made up of cooperating entities -- processors, processes, agents, peers, sensors -- and synchronization is the set of concepts, rules and mechanisms that allow them to coordinate their local computations in order to realize a common task. This book is devoted to the most difficult part of concurrent programming, namely synchronization concepts, techniques and principles when the cooperating entities are asynchronous, communicate through a shared memory, and may experience failures. Synchronization is no longer a set of tricks but, due to research results in recent decades, it relies today on sane scientific foundations as explained in this book. In this book the author explains synchronization and the implementation of concurrent objects, presenting in a uniform and comprehensive way the major theoretical and practical results of the past 30 years. Among the key features of the book are a new look at lock-based synchronization (mutual exclusion, semaphores, monitors, path expressions); an introduction to the atomicity consistency criterion and its properties and a specific chapter on transactional memory; an introduction to mutex-freedom and associated progress conditions such as obstruction-freedom and wait-freedom; a presentation of Lamport's hierarchy of safe, regular and atomic registers and associated wait-free constructions; a description of numerous wait-free constructions of concurrent objects (queues, stacks, weak counters, snapshot objects, renaming objects, etc.); a presentation of the computability power of concurrent objects including the notions of universal construction, consensus number and the associated Herlihy's hierarchy; and a survey of failure detector-based constructions of consensus objects. The book is suitable for advanced undergraduate students and graduate students in computer science or computer engineering, graduate students in mathematics interested in the foundations of process synchronization, and practitioners and engineers who need to produce correct concurrent software. The reader should have a basic knowledge of algorithms and operating systems.},

abstract = {It is very common to hear that pen-and-paper mathematics run smoother than computer-aided reason- ing. The biggest pointed problem being the overhead of information one has to provide a computer to be able to perform simple reasoning, with the upside being the absolute certainty that one is cor- rect. One such tool for computer reasoning is Agda, a dependently typed, pure, functional language. We explore this language in its two fronts: a proof-assistant and a programming language. On the proof-assistant side, we have developed a library for Relational Algebraic reasoning, which handles a big portion of the relational calculus, including a prototype of generic catamorphisms. However, the overhead of code is still present when reasoning with our library. We tackle this by automating the context inference of substitutions, based on the reflection mechanism of Agda. Our tactics allow one to perform rewrites just like on pen-and-paper mathematics. Several tactics, some of which are experimental generalizations of simpler variants, are presented with a thorough discussion on how do they work. The full source code corresponding to this dissertation is available on the internet},

abstract = {We consider the problem of deciding whether an input graph G admits a topological embedding into a two-dimensional simplicial complex C. This problem includes, among others, the embeddability problem of a graph on a surface and the topological crossing number of a graph, but is more general. The problem is NP-complete when C is part of the input, and we give a polynomial-time algorithm if the complex C is fixed. Our strategy is to reduce the problem to an embedding extension problem on a surface, which has the following form: Given a subgraph H' of a graph G', and an embedding of H' on a surface S, can that embedding be extended to an embedding of G' on S? Such problems can be solved, in turn, using a key component in Mohar's algorithm to decide the embeddability of a graph on a fixed surface (STOC 1996, SIAM J. Discr. Math. 1999).},

The problems are closely related, because the minimum cycle basis of a graph contains its minimum homology basis, and the minimum homology basis of the {\$}1{\$}-skeleton of any graph is exactly its minimum cycle basis. For the minimum cycle basis problem, we give a deterministic {\$}O(n{\^{}}\backslashomega+2{\^{}}{\{}2g{\}}n{\^{}}2+m){\$}-time algorithm for graphs embedded on an orientable surface of genus {\$}g{\$}. The best known existing algorithms for surface embedded graphs are those for general graphs: an {\$}O(m{\^{}}\backslashomega){\$} time Monte Carlo algorithm and a deterministic {\$}O(nm{\^{}}2/\backslashlog n + n{\^{}}2 m){\$} time algorithm. For the minimum homology basis problem, we give a deterministic {\$}O((g+b){\^{}}3 n \backslashlog n + m){\$}-time algorithm for graphs embedded on an orientable or non-orientable surface of genus {\$}g{\$} with {\$}b{\$} boundary components, assuming shortest paths are unique, improving on existing algorithms for many values of {\$}g{\$} and {\$}n{\$}. The assumption of unique shortest paths can be avoided with high probability using randomization or deterministically by increasing the running time of the homology basis algorithm by a factor of {\$}O(\backslashlog n){\$}.},

We begin by showing how to do simply typed functional programming, and discuss the differences between Agdas type system and the Hindley-Milner type system, which underlies mainstream typed functional programming languages like Haskell and ML. We then show how to employ dependent types for programming with functional data structures such as vectors and binary search trees. We go on to explain the Curry-Howard identification of propositions and types, and how it makes Agda not only a programming language but also a programming logic. According to Curry-Howard, we also identify programs and proofs, something which is possible only by requiring that all program terminate. However, we show in the final section a method for encoding general and possibly partial recursive functions as total functions using dependent types.},

@article{McBride2004,
abstract = {Research in dependent type theories [ML71a] has, in the past, concentrated on its use in the presentation of theorems and theorem-proving. This thesis is concerned mainly with the exploitation of the computational aspects of type theory for programming, in a context where the properties of programs may readily be specified and established. In particular, it develops technology for programming with dependent inductive families of datatypes and proving those programs correct. It demonstrates the considerable advantage to be gained by indexing data structures with pertinent characteristic information whose soundness is ensured by typechecking, rather than human effort. Type theory traditionally presents safe and terminating computation on inductive datatypes by means of elimination rules which serve as induction principles and, via their associated reduction behaviour, recursion operators [Dyb91]. In the programming language arena, these appear somewhat cumbersome and give rise to unappealing code, complicated by the inevitable interaction between case analysis on dependent types and equational reasoning on their indices which must appear explicitly in the terms. Thierry Coquand's proposal [Coq92] to equip type theory directly with the kind of pattern matching notation to which functional programmers have become used over the past three decades [Bur69, McB70] offers a remedy to many of these difficulties. However, the status of pattern matching relative to the traditional elimination rules has until now been in doubt. Pattern matching implies the uniqueness of identity proofs, which Martin Hofmann showed underivable from the conventional definition of equality [Hof95]. This thesis shows that the adoption of this uniqueness as axiomatic is sufficient t make pattern matching admissible. A datatype's elimination rule allows abstraction only over the whole inductively defined family. In order to support pattern matching, the application of such rules to specific instances of dependent families has been systematised. The underlying analysis extends beyond datatypes to other rules of a similar second order character, suggesting they may have other roles to play in the specification, verification and, perhaps, derivation of programs. The technique developed shifts the specificity from the instantiation of the type's indices into equational constraints on indices freely chosen, allowing the elimination rule to be applied. Elimination by this means leaves equational hypothesis in the resulting subgoals, which must be solved if further progress is to be made. The first-order unification algorithm for constructor forms in simple types presented in [McB96] has been extended to cover dependent datatypes as well, yielding completely automated solution to a class of problems which can be syntactically defined. The justification and operation of these techniques requires the machine to construct and exploit a standardised collection of auxiliary lemmas for each datatype. This is greatly facilitated by two technical developments of interest in their own right: a more convenient definition of equality, with a relaxed formulation rule allowing elements of different types to be compared, but nonetheless equivalent to the usual equality plus the axiom of uniqueness; a type theory, OLEG, which incorporates incomplete objects, accounting for their `holes' entirely within the typing judgments and, novelly, not requiring any notion of explicit substitution to manage their scopes. A substantial prototype has been implemented, extending the proof assistant LEGO [LP92]. A number of programs are developed by way of example. Chiefly, the increased expressivity of dependent datatypes is shown to capture a standard first-order unification algorithm within the class of structurally recursive programs, removing any need for a termination argument. Furthermore, the use of elimination rules in specifying the components of the program simplifies significantly its correctness proof.},

The category theory and homotopy theory suggest new principles to add to type theory, and type theory can be used in novel ways to formalize these areas of mathematics. In this paper, we formalize a basic result in algebraic topology, that the fundamental group of the circle is the integers. Though simple, this example is interesting for several reasons: it illustrates the new principles in homotopy type theory; it mixes ideas from traditional homotopy-theoretic proofs of the result with type-theoretic inductive reasoning; and it provides a context for understanding an existing puzzle in type theory---that a universe (type of types) is necessary to prove that the constructors of inductive types are disjoint and injective.},

abstract = {The goal of this thesis is to prove that {\$}\backslashpi{\_}4(S{\^{}}3) \backslashsimeq \backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}/2\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\$} in homotopy type theory. In particular it is a constructive and purely homotopy-theoretic proof. We first recall the basic concepts of homotopy type theory, and we prove some well-known results about the homotopy groups of spheres: the computation of the homotopy groups of the circle, the triviality of those of the form {\$}\backslashpi{\_}k(S{\^{}}n){\$} with {\$}k {\textless} n{\$}, and the construction of the Hopf fibration. We then move to more advanced tools. In particular, we define the James construction which allows us to prove the Freudenthal suspension theorem and the fact that there exists a natural number {\$}n{\$} such that {\$}\backslashpi{\_}4(S{\^{}}3) \backslashsimeq \backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}/n\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\$}. Then we study the smash product of spheres, we construct the cohomology ring of a space, and we introduce the Hopf invariant, allowing us to narrow down the {\$}n{\$} to either {\$}1{\$} or {\$}2{\$}. The Hopf invariant also allows us to prove that all the groups of the form {\$}\backslashpi{\_}{\{}4n-1{\}}(S{\^{}}{\{}2n{\}}){\$} are infinite. Finally we construct the Gysin exact sequence, allowing us to compute the cohomology of {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}C{\}}P{\^{}}2{\$} and to prove that {\$}\backslashpi{\_}4(S{\^{}}3) \backslashsimeq \backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}/2\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\$} and that more generally {\$}\backslashpi{\_}{\{}n+1{\}}(S{\^{}}n) \backslashsimeq \backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}/2\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\$} for every {\$}n \backslashge 3{\$}.},

abstract = {We study different formalizations of finite sets in homotopy type theory to obtain a general definition that exhibits both the computational facilities and the proof principles expected from finite sets. We use higher inductive types to define the type K(A) of " finite sets over type A " {\`{a}} la Kuratowski without assuming A has decidable equality. We show how to define basic functions and prove basic properties, and then we give two applications of our definition. On the foundational side, we use K to define the no-tions of " Kuratowski-finite type " and " Kuratowski-finite subobject " which we contrast with established notions, e.g., Bishop-finite types and enumerated types. We argue that Kuratowski-finiteness is the most general and flexible one of those, and we define the usual operations on finite types and subobjects. From the computational perspective, we show how to use K(A) for an abstract interface for well-known finite set im-plementations such as tree-and list-like data structures. This implies that a function defined on a concrete finite sets im-plementation can be obtained from a function defined on the abstract finite sets K(A), and correctness properties are in-herited. Hence, HoTT is the ideal setting for data refinement. Beside this, we define bounded quantification which lifts a decidable property on A to one on K(A).},

There are many stylistic choices that still allow the machine to generate a completely formal proof object. The most obvious choice is the amount of guidance required from the user, or from the machine perspective, the degree of automation provided. But another important consideration, which we consider particularly significant, is the bias towards a `procedural' or `declarative' proof style. We will explore this choice in depth, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of declarative and procedural styles for proofs in pure mathematics and for verification applications.

They may have heard arguments in favor of constructivism but are not at all convinced by them, and in any case they may care little about philosophy. A typical introductory text about construc-tivism spends a great deal of time explaining the principles and contains only trivial mathematics, while advanced constructive texts are impenetrable, like all unfamiliar mathematics. How then can a mathematician find out what constructive mathematics feels like? What new and relevant ideas does con-structive mathematics have to offer, if any? I shall attempt to answer these questions. From a psychological point of view, learning constructive mathematics is ago-nizing, for it requires one to first unlearn certain deeply ingrained intuitions and habits acquired during classical mathematical training. In her book On Death and Dying [17] psychologist Elisabeth K{\"{u}}bler-Ross identified five stages through which people reach acceptance of life's traumatizing events: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.

Most if not all AI problems can easily be formulated within this theory, which reduces the conceptual problems to pure computational ones. Considered problem classes include sequence prediction, strategic games, function minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning. The discussion includes formal definitions of intelligence order relations, the horizon problem and relations to other approaches to AI. One intention of this book is to excite a broader AI audience about abstract algorithmic information theory concepts, and conversely to inform theorists about exciting applications to AI.},

The enumeration of this set has been generated by a computer program, hence the completeness of this enumeration is essential for the proof.

Although planar graphs are usually defined by embeddings into the two-dimensional real space, this definition can hardly be used for actually developing a formal theory of planar graphs. In this paper, we take another approach; we inductively define planar graphs and prove their properties based on the inductive definition. Before the definition of planar graphs, the theory of cycles is also introduced and used as a foundation of planar graphs.

To verify these Metis proofs, we developed a tool able to translate such derivations to Agda proof-terms. We formalise in type theory each inference rule found in Metis derivations. This allowed us to type-check with Agda, Metis proofs step-by-step. We leave it for future work, the opportunity to extend this work to support other provers, proof-assistants, and formalisms.},

@article{Zeng2015a,
abstract = {With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), more and more hybrid data is being collected by information systems, which are known as Hybrid Information Systems (HIS). Based on a new hybrid distance, novel Gaussian kernel Fuzzy Rough Sets (FRS) for HIS were constructed in our previous study. In real-world applications, with the deepening of cognition and improvements in technology, attribute values in an information system often evolve over time; in particular, there are three cases: when missing values are imputed, error values are corrected, and the values are coarsened or refined. This has posed challenges to developing efficient data analysis algorithms. In this paper, the changing mechanisms of the attribute values and fuzzy equivalence relations in FRS are analyzed. FRS approaches for incrementally updating approximations in HIS are presented. Moreover, two corresponding incremental algorithms are developed. Finally, extensive experiments on eight data sets from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and an artificial data set show that incremental approaches can effectively improve the performance of updating approximations and not only significantly shorten the computational time, but also increase approximation classification accuracies.},

abstract = {Rough set theory is advocated as a framework for conceptualizing and analyzing various types of data, which is a powerful tool for discovering patterns in a given data set through a pair of concepts, namely, upper and lower approximations. Strategic behaviors need to be reinforced continuously under the dynamic decision environment where data in the decision process can change over time. Incremental learning is an effective technique to deal with dynamic learning tasks since it can make full use of previous knowledge. Set-valued data, in which a set of values are associated with an individual, is common in real-world data sets. Motivated by the needs of knowledge updating due to the dynamic variation of criteria values in the set-valued decision system, in this paper, we present the updating properties for dynamic maintenance of approximations when the criteria values in the set-valued decision system evolve with time. Then, two incremental algorithms for computing rough approximations are proposed corresponding to the addition and removal of criteria values, respectively. Experimental results show our incremental algorithms work successfully on datasets from UCI as well as artificial datasets, and achieve better performance than the traditional non-incremental method.},

abstract = {Interval-valued Information System (IvIS) is a generalized model of single-valued information system, in which the attribute values of objects are all interval values instead of single values. The attribute set in IvIS is not static but rather dynamically changing over time with the collection of new information, which results in the continuous updating of rough approximations for rough set-based data analysis. In this paper, on the basis of the similarity-based rough set model in IvIS, we develop incremental approaches for updating rough approximations in IvIS under attribute generalization, which refers to the dynamic changing of attributes. Firstly, increment relationships between the original rough approximations and the updated ones when adding or deleting an attribute set are analyzed, respectively. And the incremental mechanisms for updating rough approximations in IvIS are introduced, which carry out the computation using the previous results from the original data set along with new results. Then, the corresponding incremental algorithms are designed based on the proposed mechanisms. Finally, comparative experiments on data sets from UCI as well as artificial data sets are conducted, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed incremental algorithms can effectively reduce the running time for the computation of rough approximations in comparison with the static algorithm.},

@article{Zhang2015,
abstract = {As the volume of data grows at an unprecedented rate, large-scale data mining and knowledge discovery present a tremendous challenge. Rough set theory, which has been used successfully in solving problems in pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining, centers around the idea that a set of distinct objects may be approximated via a lower and upper bound. In order to obtain the benefits that rough sets can provide for data mining and related tasks, efficient computation of these approximations is vital. The recently introduced cloud computing model, MapReduce, has gained a lot of attention from the scientific community for its applicability to large-scale data analysis. In previous research, we proposed a MapReduce-based method for computing approximations in parallel, which can efficiently process complete data but fails in the case of missing (incomplete) data. To address this shortcoming, three different parallel matrix-based methods are introduced to process large-scale, incomplete data. All of them are built on MapReduce and implemented on Twister that is a lightweight MapReduce runtime system. The proposed parallel methods are then experimentally shown to be efficient for processing large-scale data.},

Given their universality and usefulness, it is imperative to ask if call graphs exhibit any intrinsic graph theoretic features - across versions, program domains and source languages. This work is an attempt to answer these questions: we present and investigate a set of meaningful graph measures that help us understand call graphs better; we establish how these measures correlate, if any, across different languages and program domains; we also assess the overall, language independent software quality by suitably interpreting these measures.},

The already known approaches, e.g. based on the tolerance relations, deal with the missing value case. We introduce two generalisations of the rough sets theory to handle these situations. The first generalisation introduces the use of a non symmetric similarity relation in order to formalise the idea of absent value semantics. The second proposal is based on the use of valued tolerance relations. A logical analysis and the computational experiments show that for the valued tolerance approach it is possible to obtain more informative approximations and decision rules than using the approach based on the simple tolerance relation.},

abstract = {General recursive algorithms are such that the recursive calls are performed on arguments satisfying no condition that guarantees termination. Hence, there is no direct way of formalising them in type theory. The standard way of handling general recursion in type theory uses a well-founded recursion principle. Unfortunately, this way of formalising general recursive algorithms often produces unnecessarily long and complicated codes. On the other hand, functional programming languages like Haskell impose no restrictions on recursive programs, and then writing general recursive algorithms is straightforward. In addition, functional programs are usually short and self-explanatory. However, the existing frameworks for reasoning about the correctness of Haskell-like programs are weaker than the framework provided by type theory. The goal of this work is to present a method that combines the advantages of both programming styles when writing simple general recursive algorithms....},

QCDCL is an extension of the conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) paradigm implemented in state of the art propositional satisfiability (SAT) solvers. The Q-resolution calculus (QRES) is a QBF proof system which underlies QCDCL. QCDCL solvers can produce QRES proofs of QBFs in prenex conjunctive normal form (PCNF) as a byproduct of the solving process. In contrast to traditional QCDCL based on QRES, DepQBF 6.0 implements a variant of QCDCL which is based on a generalization of QRES. This generalization is due to a set of additional axioms and leaves the original Q-resolution rules unchanged. The generalization of QRES enables QCDCL to potentially produce exponentially shorter proofs than the traditional variant. We present an overview of the features imple-mented in DepQBF and report on experimental results which demonstrate the effectiveness of generalized QRES in QCDCL.},

abstract = {Boolean Satisfiability is probably the most studied of combinatorial optimization/search problems. Significant effort has been devoted to trying to provide practical solutions to this problem for problem instances encountered in a range of applications in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), as well as in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study has culminated in the development of several SAT packages, both proprietary and in the public domain (e.g. GRASP, SATO) which find significant use in both research and industry. Most existing complete solvers are variants of the Davis-Putnam (DP) search algorithm. In this paper we describe the development of a new complete solver, Chaff, which achieves significant performance gains through careful engineering of all aspects of the search - especially a particularly efficient implementation of Boolean constraint propagation (BCP) and a novel low overhead decision strategy. Chaff has been able to obtain one to two orders of magnitude performance improvement on difficult SAT benchmarks in comparison with other solvers (DP or otherwise), including GRASP and SATO.},

The core engine consists of de{\{}{\}}nable update rules for changing plausibility relations between worlds, which have been proposed independently in the dynamic-epistemic literature on preference change. Our analysis yields two new types of modal result. First, we obtain complete logics for concrete mechanisms of belief revision, based on compositional reduction axioms. Next, we show how various ab- stract postulates for belief revision can be analyzed by standard modal frame correspondences for model-changing operations.},

It chooses facts related to this goal and asks some automatic provers to find a proof. The proof can be either reconstructed or just used to extract the relevant lemmas: in both cases the proof is not trusted. We extend the support by adding one first-order prover (Zipperposition), the reconstruction for two higher-order ATPs (Leo-II and Satallax) and an SMT solver veriT. The support of higher-order prover should especially improve Sledgehammer's performance for higher-order goals. Acknowledgement I would like to thank Jasmin Blanchette for the internship about a very interesting subject, and the members of the logic and verification chair for the welcome.

@article{Norell2009,
abstract = {Dependently typed languages have for a long time been used to describe proofs about programs. Traditionally, dependent types are used mostly for stating and proving the properties of the programs and not in defining the programs themselves. An impressive example is the certified compiler by Leroy (2006) implemented and proved correct in Coq (Bertot and Cast{\'{e}}ran 2004). Recently there has been an increased interest in dependently typed programming, where the aim is to write programs that use the dependent type system to a much higher degree. In this way a lot of the properties that were previously proved separately can be integrated in the type of the program, in many cases adding little or no complexity to the definition of the program. New languages, such as Epigram (McBride and McKinna 2004), are being designed, and existing languages are being extended with new features to accomodate these ideas, for instance the work on dependently typed programming in Coq by Sozeau (2007). This talk gives an overview of the Agda programming language (Norell 2007), whose main focus is on dependently typed programming. Agda provides a rich set of inductive types with a powerful mechanism for pattern matching, allowing dependently typed programs to be written with minimal fuss. To read about programming in Agda, see the lecture notes from the Advanced Functional Programming summer school (Norell 2008) and the work by Oury and Swierstra (2008). In the talk a number of examples of interesting dependently typed programs chosen from the domain of programming language implementation are presented as they are implemented in Agda.},

@book{Jackson2006,
abstract = {{\{}In Software Abstractions Daniel Jackson introduces a new approach to software design that draws on traditional formal methods but exploits automated tools to find flaws as early as possible. This approach--which Jackson calls "lightweight formal methods" or "agile modeling"--takes from formal specification the idea of a precise and expressive notation based on a tiny core of simple and robust concepts but replaces conventional analysis based on theorem proving with a fully automated analysis that gives designers immediate feedback. Jackson has developed Alloy, a language that captures the essence of software abstractions simply and succinctly, using a minimal toolkit of mathematical notions. The designer can use automated analysis not only to correct errors but also to make models that are more precise and elegant. This approach, Jackson says, can rescue designers from "the tarpit of implementation technologies" and return them to thinking deeply about underlying concepts. Software Abstractions introduces the key elements of the approach: a logic, which provides the building blocks of the language; a language, which adds a small amount of syntax to the logic for structuring descriptions; and an analysis, a form of constraint solving that offers both simulation (generating sample states and executions) and checking (finding counterexamples to claimed properties). The book uses Alloy as a vehicle because of its simplicity and tool support, but the book's lessons are mostly language-independent, and could also be applied in the context of other modeling languages.{\}}},

@book{Baier2008,
abstract = {Our growing dependence on increasingly complex computer and software systems necessitates the development of formalisms, techniques, and tools for assessing functional properties of these systems. One such technique that has emerged in the last twenty years is model checking, which systematically (and automatically) checks whether a model of a given system satisfies a desired property such as deadlock freedom, invariants, or request-response properties. This automated technique for verification and debugging has developed into a mature and widely used approach with many applications. Principles of Model Checking offers a comprehensive introduction to model checking that is not only a text suitable for classroom use but also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the field. The book begins with the basic principles for modeling concurrent and communicating systems, introduces different classes of properties (including safety and liveness), presents the notion of fairness, and provides automata- based algorithms for these properties. It introduces the temporal logics LTL and CTL, compares them, and covers algorithms for verifying these logics, discussing real-time systems as well as systems subject to random phenomena. Separate chapters treat such efficiency-improving techniques as abstraction and symbolic manipulation. The book includes an extensive set of examples (most of which run through several chapters) and a complete set of basic results accompanied by detailed proofs. Each chapter concludes with a summary, bibliographic notes, and an extensive list of exercises of both practical and theoretical nature.},

abstract = {We present a way to enjoy the power of SAT and SMT provers in Coq without compromising soundness. This requires these provers to return not only a yes/no answer, but also a proof witness that can be independently rechecked. We present such a checker, written and fully certified in Coq. It is conceived in a modular way, in order to tame the proofs' complexity and to be extendable. It can currently check witnesses from the SAT solver ZChaff and from the SMT solver veriT. Experiments highlight the efficiency of this checker. On top of it, new reflexive Coq tactics have been built that can decide a subset of Coq's logic by calling external provers and carefully checking their answers.},

abstract = {PRocH is a proof reconstruction tool that imports in HOL Light proofs produced by ATPs on the recently developed translation of HOL Light and Flyspeck problems to ATP formats. PRocH combines several reconstruction methods in parallel, but the core improvement over previous methods is obtained by re-playing in the HOL logic the detailed inference steps recorded in the ATP (TPTP) proofs, using several internal HOL Light inference methods. These methods range from fast variable matching and more involved rewriting, to full first-order theorem proving using the MESON tactic. The system is described and its performance is evaluated here on a large set of Flyspeck problems.},

In the making of Waldmeister, we have applied an engineering approach, identifying the critical points with respect to efficiency in time and space. Our logical three-level system model consists of the basic operations on the lowest level, where we put great stress on efficient data structures and algorithms. For the middle level, where the inference steps are aggregated into an inference machine, flexible adjustment has proven essential during experimental evaluation. The top level holds control strategy and reduction ordering. Although at this level only standard strategies are employed, really large proof tasks have been managed in reasonable time.},

Both SAT solvers generate resolution-style proofs for (instances of) propositional tautologies. These proofs are verified by the theorem provers. The presented approach significantly improves the provers' performance on propositional problems, and exhibits counterexamples for unprovable conjectures. It is also shown that LCF-style theorem provers can serve as viable proof checkers even for large SAT problems. An efficient representation of the propositional problem in the theorem prover turns out to be crucial; several possible solutions are discussed. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

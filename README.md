Mini-HoTT : another library for Univalent Foundations in Agda
------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this library is to provide the basis to learn and to use homotopy
type theory (HoTT) to formalize mathematics. For instance, we are using this library to
formalize planar graphs as we showed in TYPES2019. There are many other
libraries in which we have based this developed, so we don't  claim any credit
unless we state it. Nevertheless, we have included so many changes as for example
our own intuition, pictures, proofs and naming. Please, see the complete list of
references that are on the website at the end, the References section.
